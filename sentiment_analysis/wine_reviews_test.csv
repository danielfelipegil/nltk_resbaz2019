2734,France,"Lifted notes of dried pear, dried chamomile flowers and dried lemon peel have a strong impact. The palate comes in with lovely generous sweetness that amplifies that chamomile-tisane notion and boosts the dried-fruit notes. Against the distinctly medium-sweet fruitiness stands a clarion line of acidity. The evolution of fruit flavors weaves a colorful tapestry of aromas. This is carefully balanced and quietly intense. It holds immense strength at its core that radiates flavor and fruit. Made from a field blend of Alsace varieties, each adds something: aroma, texture, freshness and body.

This shows lovely flavors of maturity but has only just got going. The freshness is incisive, the complexity and length immense. This is simply beautiful and leaves you totally refreshed. Savor this slowly. Drink now through 2030.",Osterberg Grand Cru,95,38,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Cave de Ribeauvillé
2736,France,"An incredibly pure and piercing note of lemon oil hits the nose. The medium-sweet palate impresses with both fresh and dried notes of fruit: plum, white sultana, white currant and the ripest pear and apple you can imagine. This is full-on and big but balanced by tingling, fresh and precise acidity. A field blend of polar opposites, Riesling and Gewurztraminer, this unites their virtues of aromatic textured richness and poised finesse. Again, this is not a wine that is easily categorized with its medium-sweet, soil- and fruit-driven profile, but it is a joy to experience and savor. The finish lasts and lasts.

2740,France,"A lovely touch of flint and smoke carry a touch of residual reduction. Underneath that is lemony purity. The palate adds a touch of stone fruit, a touch of ripe mirabelle plum—its generosity only underlined by the taut lemon freshness that pervades the wine. There is something stern and stony at the core, something fundamental and profound. The body is precise, dry and powerful and incredibly moreish.

The palate cuts in with uncompromising purity and zestiness—this really wants to showcase pure stone and tart citrus. There are glimpses, however, of plump ripe mirabelle plums and a touch of dried pear and quince. Nonetheless, this is governed by stern tanginess and thus is for real adults only. This is dry, slender and shows absolute focus. A celebration of stone and Riesling. Don't drink this now but wait: Drink 2020–2035.",Engelberg Grand Cru,95,45,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Domaine Pfister
2745,France,"The heady scent of Damask rose hints unmistakably to Gewürztraminer.

The length is astonishing and dreamy. This is dangerously delicious.",Grand Cru Pfersigberg Doux,95,90,Alsace,Alsace,,Gewürztraminer,Domaine Barmès-Buecher
2746,France,"After a touch of funky reduction, beautiful hints of herbs appear: yarrow and lemon balm play alongside lemon and crisp green-apple aromas. On the palate, these notions all remain taut along a very linear, slender but concentrated body that owes more to citrus than to apples. There is a powerful enduring core of fruit and stone that will make this last. The flavors echo long and leave the mouth totally clean.

Screwcap.",Clos du Papillon,93,,Loire Valley,Savennières,,Chenin Blanc,Domaine des Baumard
11149,France,"Firmly in the style of the vintage, this is dense, full-bodied Cornas, with plenty of fruit. Intense plum, coffee and black olive notes dominate, while the tannins are ripe and plush.

11153,France,"Wood-aged wine, showing both spice and ripe tropical fruits. Mango and pineapple combine with vanilla and coconut milk to give a full, rich wine, though with Sauvignon Blanc's fresh acidity.

11156,France,"Now in golden maturity, this is a smooth, unctuous and ripe wine. Honey is the dominant character, a perfumed wild flower honey that is layered with intense acidity that lifts the wine in a beautiful way. A sweet wine yes, but one that is so balanced.",Cuvée le Paon,93,,Loire Valley,Coteaux du Layon,,Chenin Blanc,Domaine des Baumard
11160,France,"Incredibly pure notes of freshly cut Cox's Orange Pippin assail the nose. The palate has the same purity and a linear, taut, rich but toned body that is yet to reveal all of its secrets. The purity and luminoisty of the fruit is astonishing.

11168,France,"Ripe Mirabelle plums and tart, red apples mix to give a very fruity, appetizing aspect which on the palate is joined by ripe, lemony freshness.

Still young, oozing potential. Drink 2017–2030.",Wiebelsberg Grand Cru,94,35,Alsace,Alsace,,Riesling,Boeckel
11173,France,"Stone, earth and hay are about to merge into notions of lanolin and chamomile: clearly this is a maturing wine at an early point of its evolution. The palate is fluid and has the texture of drenched chalky, stone. The fruit is hiding in the wings, only to appear as orange oil here or as apple scent there. The dryness shows every nuance of this earthy, wine from a historic, co-planed vineyard of Riesling, Pinot Gris and Gewurztraminer. What a triumph. Drink 2016–2026.",Osterberg Grand Cru Clos du Zahnacker,94,49,Alsace,Alsace,,Alsace white blend,Cave de Ribeauvillé
11174,France,"A wealth of notions hits the palate: baked apple, fir honey, lemon-scented caramel and burnt sugar. The palate does not hold back, either, and lets all these notions dance in swirls of dizzying richness.

11175,France,"This is a full-bodied wine that exudes yellow fruits and a smooth structure.

11176,France,"The nose is still closed, there is an almost smoky aspect and a promise of far more perfume in the future. The palate comes with great concentration of still tightly coiled lemon zest notes but the aftertaste is almost salty. This is dry, linear, muscular and toned, affording glimpses of future grandeur through dense lemon and lime zestiness. Give this some time in bottle.

11179,France,"Softly scented with tart apple and fresh citrus, this unfolds into an array of shimmering, tart, fresh but full-fruited apple notes.

11188,France,"Fulsome notes of ripe, juicy pear lead straight to a fluid, concentrated palate that holds a whole world of ripe pear flavors. This is still deep in its shell, ringing with primary fruit but burying many layers of spiced joy: think marzipan and gingerbread. This is one for laying down that will reward patient drinkers. The deep core of fruit, the concentration on the midpalate and the ultraclean finish all suggest a great future.

11198,France,"This wine, with its noticeable proportion of Cabernet Sauvignon (20%), has structure and a tangy texture as well as plenty of bright crisp fruit.

11237,France,"The nose is reminiscent of dried pine cones and miso.

This calls out for food—think game and mushroom dishes. The finish is juicy, refreshing and moreish.",Cuvée Fernand,90,30,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Noir,Domaine Fernand Engel
11239,France,"A superripe structured wine that has serious tannins and a smoky dark character.

Drink this powerful wine from 2024.",,90,,Bordeaux,Saint-Émilion,,Bordeaux-style Red Blend,Château Monbousquet
11240,France,There is a hint of earth and roasted pumpkin on the nose. The palate has a similarly smoky and dusky aspect and surrounds crisp red-cherry fruit. The body is light with a slight but fine tannic grip. A pleasantly bitter finish counters the pumpkin richness. The finish is very fresh and dry but strangely moreish. This will benefit from a bit of bottle age. Drink now through 2022.,Lieu-Dit Sundel,90,45,Alsace,Alsace,,Pinot Noir,Emile Beyer
11241,France,Bosc pear plays on nose and palate. The ripe and aromatic fruit is countered by ample freshness and even a little spice on the palate.

11244,France,"Faint and restrained notes of rose petal and orange peel make for an inviting scent.

11299,France,"With its wonderful poise between dark structure and intensely fragrant fruit, this is firm, dry and packed with ripe blackberry fruits.

11308,France,"This is as serious as Provence rosé can get. It is a limited production wine, selected from the best Grenache (75%) and Syrah (25%) parcels.

11334,France,"This textured wine shows wood flavors from its 30% new wood. To balance it has great ripe fruits and a tight texture of acidity. The wine is still nervy, closed up with minerality.

11433,France,"Sure, it starts out a bit toasty and cedary, but that wood will surely integrate with the potent plummy, meaty fruit given a few years' time.
