# Natural Language Processing at Resbaz 2019

Each directory contains jupyter notebooks and python files given by the presenters. Some datasets could be missing due to large files restriction in github (but can be easily found on google to download).

Note: Notebooks for topic modelling, sentiment analysis and word meaning where created with [Google Collaboratory]( https://colab.research.google.â€¦) so I would suggest to use the tool available for any gmail account. You can also use [Jupyter Notebooks] (https://jupyter.org) or any python IDE of your preference.

Please contact me if you have any issues reproducing the results.
